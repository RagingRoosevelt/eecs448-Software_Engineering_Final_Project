A Github repository (https://github.com/RagingRoosevelt/eecs448fp) will be used to store different pieces of the project for viewing and editing by team members. Team members will upload their contributions to the project and make comments telling the other team members what changes they have made.  Given the separation of tasks, it has not been necessary to branch the repository and everyone has successfully worked with the main branch.
